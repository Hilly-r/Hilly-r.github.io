    <p>My name is Hillary although most people call me Hilly. I’m currently studying Introduction to IT at RMIT as a means to see If I’m cut out to do a full-fledged bachelor’s degree in computer science, or even better, Software engineering. 
I originally hail from Perth but have been living in Melbourne for the past decade. I originally moved over to study Architecture at Melbourne but decided it wasn’t for me. Since then I’ve been gadding about. Studying Science and Politics here and there, working and occasionally travelling. My biggest sin is that I don’t have any outstanding hobbies, but I do like to do things most people like to do. 
</p>
	  <p>I chose to study at RMIT because it is a well-ranked University both within Australia and Globally. More specifically, it places amongst the world’s top 150 universities for computing and IT and is known to prepare its students for the workforce. </p><br><br>

    <p><span class="w3-large w3-margin-right w3-text-light-grey">Myers-Briggs</span></p><br>
	  <p>Introverted – Intuitive – Thinking – Perceiving</p><br>

   <p>The internet tells me that this INTP personality type has great ability to think logically and abstractly but because of the constant knowledge seeking and thinking they are seen by others as absent minded professors. 
    I’m sceptical of online personality tests but I can’t help recognising some matching traits in the description. 
    INTPs are said to value knowledge above all else, not be good with deadlines nor hierarchy, need a large amount of autonomy and are generally cynical. All of this is true for me and I relate to personalitypages.com words which said that us INTPs see everything in terms of how it can be improved.

	  <p>50% Visual</p>
	  <p>35% Auditory</p>
	  <p>15% Tactile</p><br>
	  <p>This result tells me that I learn by reading and looking at pictures, which I know is true. 
I need to write down what I hear if I’m going to remember it and have trouble with spoken directions. I thought I would score higher on tactile, as I do need to do things to have them really engrained.

	  <p>Investigative 19</p>
	  <p>Artistic 19</p><br>
    <p>The Investigative type is analytical, intelligent and complex. They need constant stimulation and freedom to explore. The Artistic type are the creators, they explore ideas and avoid the mundane and need loosely structured environments.
These results mirror my Myers-Briggs results and list computer programming as a fitting profession. 
</p><br><br>
 
	  <p>Whilst my Myers-Briggs test results state otherwise, I do actually enjoy working in teams when the environment is right, and communication is open. I know I need others to hear my ideas, keep me in check from second-guessing myself and particularly keep me on track with deadlines. When forming a team, I need to match with those who like to work autonomously on specific tasks and then come together to combine the effort afterwards, with check-ins in-between. </p><br><br>

    <!--<h3 class="w3-padding-16 w3-text-light-grey">INTEREST</h3>-->
    <!--<hr style="width:200px" class="w3-opacity">-->
    <p> My real interest in IT began after seeing the flexibility of IT jobs through a Software Developer friend. Really, I was jealous that he got to stay at home some days and could make the computer do things which I couldn’t. Something about the black screen filled with code reminded me of the fun DOS games I used to play in computer class and quite instantaneously after trying some basic coding myself, the world of technology and computing didn’t seem so ungraspable.</p> 

<p>I think the most interesting thing about IT is its unmatchable reach and how quickly it has become a central structure in our daily lives. Our commute, workplace, homes and social lives have radically changed in every aspect due to IT. While technology has always made it’s advances and inevitable changes to the way we live, Modern IT has exponentially grown in a period less than three decades. I think this is because how accessible and simplified things become when everything is connected, and this interconnectedness is what most intrigues me. I also have a soft spot for cybersecurity and will never tire of hearing about STUXNET.
 </p>
		<p>By studying IT, I hope to learn deep technical skills and the theory behind them so that I have a complete understanding of computing systems in general. Ultimately, I would like to learn the fundamentals of cyber security and how internet technologies integrate with one another. I would also like to learn how to better communicate my growing knowledge as a medium between technical experts and lay people. </p><br><br>
    
    <h3 class="w3-padding-16 w3-text-light-grey">EXPERIENCE</h3>
    <p> I’ve been working as a Business Analyst in the banking industry for the last two years and have been lucky enough to get some good hands-on technical skills. I was very lucky and fell into the job, I’m still not quite sure how but I’m grateful, nonetheless. I’ve been involved in System administration, process analysis and improvement, enterprise data management and database mapping. Specifically, for the purpose of transformational projects. I’ve managed to get some basic coding experience which would have to be one of my favourite parts of the job but I’m not an expert by any means. Languages I use or have used are SQL, Python, javascript and COBOL (my absolute favourite). I’m still eagerly learning and hope to add html and CSS to my repertoire.  </p><br>

    <!-- IDEAL JOB -->
    <h3 class="w3-padding-16 w3-text-light-grey">IDEAL JOB</h3>
    <p>My Ideal IT job would be to become a Software Engineer or any of the job titles that fall under this banner. </p>
    <p>The use of technical knowledge, requirement investigation, communicating with other people/stakeholders and design to solve complex problems is what most appeals about this role. </p>
		<p>To become a software engineer you need an undergraduate degree in Computer Science or IT if not a straight software engineering degree. This needs to be followed by a number of years of experience as a software developer. </p><br>
		
		<p>This job in particular would be amazing!</p>
		<a href="https://www.amazon.jobs/en/jobs/927017/software-development-engineer-whole-foods-market-tech" class="w3-text-light-grey"> Wholefoods Software engineer</a><br>
    <p>I love wholefoods food so this role – using C, C++, C#, Java or Perl to code for the technological implementation of large-scale business needs for a wholefoods/amazon service - would get me all-the-more closer to it.</p>
		<p>For me to get this ideal job I’ll need to finish my studies in IT and advance quickly with my current coding skills. For work I will need to focus on more technical areas, but I believe being a business analyst with exposure to business workings and stakeholder management puts me in good stead to understand the business side of the job.</p>
